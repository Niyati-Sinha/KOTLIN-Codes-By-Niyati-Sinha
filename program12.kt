//without mentioning data type nullable strings can be defined at the first level only

/*
like if I am declaring a variable without giving data type then at the very first initialization,
it is strictly necessary that it is null then only it will be treated as a nullable variable
 */

/*but here again there is a condition that if at the very first initialization it is declared without
mentioning data type as null (the only way possible to assign null without mentioning data type
then it can not be reassigned as if we try to reassign it will show an error
that it does not know the original data type of the variable and treated it as null
 */

/*
Thus we can conclude that if we want to declare nullable variable of a particular data type
then we need to explicitly mention the data type
